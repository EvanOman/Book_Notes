= Chapter 3: A Recipe for Success

== My Notes

=== Intro

	* "Recipe for success" gives managers a guideline for enacting change while minimizing resistance
		** Focus on Quality
		** Reduce WIP
		** Deliver Often
		** Balance Demand vs Throughput
		** Prioritize
		** Attack Sources of Variability
	* First step is easiest, others require skills in articulation, negotiation, psychology, sociology, and emotional intelligence
	* Developing trust is a good start, quality can help do that
	* Final step is very difficult, accomplishing this would be a sign of exceptional tech leadership

=== Focus on Quality

	* Poor quality is often a business's biggest cost: up to 90% of time and code
	* Keys to improving quality:
		** Testing
		** Collab analysis and design
		** Static analysis
		** Code inspectors
		** Design patterns
	* Reducing the quantity of design in progress boosts software quality

=== Reduce WIP and Deliver Often

	* Case Study: Nokia team which limited WIP and added unit tests saw a 10x reduction in lead time and a 30x reduction on time spent on defects (also used collaboration)
	* More WIP tends to cause poorer quality
	* Poor performing team was better on paper, process affected more than people
	* More releases of higher quality code build trust w/ other teams

=== Balance Demand Against Throughput

	* This means setting a rate of new feature acceptance
	* Limiting WIP exposes the real bottlenecks
	* Some slack is good: "You need slack to enable continuous improvement"
	* "Optimizing for utilization is not desirable"

=== Prioritize

	* Ops should now be smooth, now focus on value not quantity
	* Priority is a business decision, not engineering
	* Ultimately the main metric is business value, tho this is hard to measure

=== Attach Source of Variability to Improve Predictability

	* "variability in the size of reqs and in the amount of effort expended on analysis, design, coding, testing, and building and delivery adversely affect throughput and cost"
